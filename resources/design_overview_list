STUN related:
- Why is de-multiplexing necessary
- Because we receive more than only a single protocol on one socket
- How do we de-multiplex
- Currently on the second-highest bit in the first byte
- Reason why we decided against multiplexing on STUN magic cookie
- Why don't we use the STUN inside of QUIC
- Currently only a draft, already changed quit significantly during the thesis
- Additional security through 0RTT minimized, otherwise add. RTT
- Observer can also observe infos by looking at packeet
- Not supported in public STUN/TURN servers
ICE related:
- Cannot start a completely new connection
- External signalling channel is missing, only minor drawback
- We did not change the number of probes sent, decrease restart on failure
- Keep it general purpose
- How do we resolve the roles in ICE
- Automatically assigned by the roles of our connection
- 
QUIC related:
- We need to communicate excluding existing paths, otherwise probed twice
- How to manage the ICE implementation?
- Restarting after pre-defined time or error
- Forward the ICE TURN packets
- Relay received TURN packets to ICE
- Talk about alternative, implementation directly in QUIC
- Added synchronization, better results when not synchronized, implementation issue because ICE agent doesn't support restart
- When and what does the ICE agent tell us?
- What do we tell the ICE agent?
- What timeouts did we add? How did we choose them?
