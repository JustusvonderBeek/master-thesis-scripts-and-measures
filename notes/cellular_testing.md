# Notes Regarding the Cellular Real-Life Tests
Some information to look up later on and find infos during writing

## Setup
The setup was kinda hard. Driver was installed, but the card was not recognized at first. Turns out one had to switch the SIM card to another slot first. Then, the modem firmware was not accessible because of some US regulation requirements. This could be unlocked by running a script from the Lenovo website. Afterwards, the connection could be established via the nmcli tool or GUI. Now it seems the modem is working. Comments about the bad connectivity seemed to be not true for my device.

```bash
mmcli -m 0 # Showing output of the modem
mmcli -m 1 --set-primary-sim-slot=1 # Switching to the hardware sim card instead of some bogus eSim
nmcli -m 0 radio wwan0 on # <- My memory only, check if cmd correct
nmcli -m 0 connection wwan0 up "Drillisch"
```

## Analysis
The conclusion from the Signal tests.

| Tests Considered | Status | Characteristics Analyzed | Findings | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 13.06 10:05-11:00 | Success | Default Signal Behavior | Using ICE to probe on all Interfaces, building TURN paths on all possible interfaces + IPs, building P2P path on WiFi, cellular -> eduroam probed but not responded, ICE includes IPv4 & IPv6, cellular paths are not P2P probed (neither IPv4 nor IPv6) | TURN includes full TURN attributes, lifetime, real etc; P2P includes ICE, prio, message integr., goog-net-info, username, fingerprint |
| 13.06 10:05-11:00 | Success | Path Maintenance | Using STUN to keep path open, active every ~2.5s, inactive every ~4s | TURN includes full TURN attributes, lifetime, real etc; P2P includes ICE, prio, message integr., goog-net-info, username, fingerprint |
| 13.06 11:08-11:19 | Failure | Migration | When both in same AP, migration completely fails | Turning the AP off at the same time, leads to STUN being send to TURN and locally but no connection is established |
| 13.06 11:26-14:xx | Success | Migration when one device loses connectivity | Finding local WiFi path, Switching to TURN using STUN to relay data, using IPv6 eduroam and cellular to send data, efforts to build cellular path via IPv6 to other cellular and to eduroam but both fail, cellular fails because this path is not probed by the existing client back, both only probe towards eduroam not towards other ISP | Turning the AP off leads to noticeable interruption of  ~2-10s, takes a long time until call notices  |
| 13.06 11:26-14:55 | Success | Migration when one device regains connectivity | Turning WiFi back on leads to re-probing from device that found WiFi again, probing local path with STUN, connected device answers, local path is found and used | Delay not noticeable when turning WiFi back on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |


### General Flow
The general flow of the Signal Video Call. My Account starts the call, the other one accepts

Caller:
1. Connect to Signal SIP TURN Server with plain STUN (from all possible Interfaces, WiFi + Cellular IPv4, IPv6)
2. Connect to Signal TURN Server via TCP on HTTP + HTTPS
3. Allocate Transport UDP (fails until Credentials given) with lifetime 600s = 10m
4. TURN Server Returns the Allocated Public IPv4
5. Exchange Call Information with TURN Server via TCP
6. CreatePermission request from all IPs to other peers IPs
7. Server answers CreatePermission Success
8. Building direct P2P with ICE using STUN many attributes (WiFi, Cellular, ...)
9. Using direct P2P path to send RTP
10. Keep alives on active path every ~2.5s FROM the sender, swapping every binding request, idle paths (TURN, cellular->eduroam) path every ~4s
11. Close TCP STUN connection, close UDP TURN connection with lifetime refresh = 0

On failure:
1. Sending STUN allocation to server
2. But never continue sending RTP data
3. Call finally fails

Callee:
1. Notification from Google / AWS Service about incoming call?
2. Connect to Signal TURN Server (again, with all interfaces + IPs)
3. Create Permission request to connect from all IPs to all caller IPs (192.168.2.17)
4. CreatePermission Success
5. Building direct P2P path with ICE using STUN and many attributes (including PATH being WiFi / Cellular)
6. Exchange data
7. Keep alives every ~2.5s on active path, swapping each iteration the origin
8. Closing call, set refresh lifetime of TURN bindings to 0

## Analysis
The analysis for the ICE prototype.

| Tests Considered | Status | Characteristics Analyzed | Findings | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 06.06 11:30 | Failure | Path Probing | Ethernet Priority is too high, all STUN probings are sent on the ethernet path with Cellular never found | For next tests reduce ethernet path prio below cellular prio |
| 06.06 11:46-14:07 | Failure | Path Probing | STUN probes sent on cellular path but never received on cellular path | Carriers might block STUN IPv4? |
| 06.06 14:15-14:21 | Failure | Path Probing | Confirmed o2 STUN not arriving | Carriers blocks STUN IPv4? |
| 06.06 14:27-14:30 | Failure | Path Probing | Confirmed Telekom STUN not arriving | Carriers blocks STUN IPv4? |
| 06.06 14:45-15:52 | Failure | Confirm STUN blocked | With STUN or random UDP still blocked, even if only a single side is behind carrier | Carrier blocks IPv4 P2P |
| 11.06 16:01-16:13 | Failure | Confirm all STUN blocked | Even with all attributes removed, no packet is allowed to pass from ISP to ISP | Both behind ISP firewall |
| 11.06 16:20-16:45 | Failure | Confirm plain STUN blocked | For o2 and telekom all incoming or outgoing UDP is blocked | For both nothing reaches the other side |
| 11.06 16:58-17:10 | Success | Confirm plain STUN blocked | For o2 STUN arrives at AWS instance | AWS is set to let everything pass |
| 11.06 17:14-17:19 | Success | Confirm plain STUN blocked | For telekom STUN arrives at AWS instance | AWS is set to let everything pass |
| 12.06 16:12-16:20 | Success | Confirm P2P ISP possible | For Telekom, P2P between same IP is possible, Connection can be build | external and internal IP are the same (internal: 37.82.129.214), Might be Hairpinning involved |
| 12.06 16:27-16:29 | Success | Confirm P2P ISP possible | For o2, P2P in the 10.131.244.xx network is possible, STUN requests to the 176.2.131.x public IP are un-answered | Might be Hairpinning involved |
| 12.06 16:50-16:59 | Success | Confirm P2P Telekom possible | For Telekom, P2P between Cellular IPv4 and Eduroam is possible | Blocking of STUN at o2 confirmed |
| 12.06 17:06-18:11 | Success | Checked swapped SIM cards make a difference | When swapped, the path can be build via the given interfaces, Telekom seems to be Endpoint Independent Filtering (remote packets reach us before packets on the same port leave), maybe keep bindings alive during tests | Direct Access of Laptop to Telekom network seems to be the trick... |
| 12.06 18:21-19:07 | Failure | Check APN configuration | First, internet.v6.telekom doesn't work, internet.telekom doesn't work, public IP internet.t-d1.de doesn't work, switching phones doesn't work, changing direction also doesn't work | Problem in APN configuration, plus blocking on some interface due to direction and device |
| 12.06 19:24-19:39 | Failure | Check Telekom STUN | APN internet.telekom only finding 10.x.x.x/x address, not external one | Blocking all incoming, not supporting Hairpinning |

## Analysis
The Analysis of the tests before

| Tests Considered | Status | Characteristics Analyzed | Findings | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 05.06 10:35 | Failed | Robustness | Fails even under perfect conditions, with TCP closing gracefully? | Using TCP, no migration is possible. Packet or data inspection which *could* fail? |
| 05.06 10:35 | Failed | Default Behavior | When connected to 10.0.0.0/8 WiFi sometimes using TCP via AP to share data, no WiFi Hotspot, Cellular Data not considered on default | Fails |
| 05.06 10:46-12:10 | Success | Default Behavior | When in 192.168.0.0/16 network, using TCP via WiFi-Hotspot (Device AP) to share data | Transfer not encrypted, fast & successful |
| 05.06 10:46-12:10 | Success | Transfer Speed | Via WiFi-Hotspot fast, via AP slower | --- |
| 05.06 10:46-12:10 | Success | Path Building | Using mDNS in local network to find other peer, testing connection with ICMP ping, no STUN used | Only in local AP adapter mDNS etc. |
| 05.06 15:27-15:58 | Success | Path Building | mDNS + TCP + ICMP is not always observed when in 10.0.0.0/24 HHG network | Transfer is encrypted via AES-256-CRC (exchanged parameter) |
| 05.06 16:58-17:21 | Success | Path Building | Exchange with Google after failed mDNS (trying >10s), *must contain WiFi IP*, trying TCP directly to WiFi IP (different WiFi), **fails**, no STUN no path building, takes >35-50s to shut down WiFi and switch to WiFi-Hotspot with one phone being AP | Transfer is slow at first, then WiFi turned off in top bar, then faster |
| 05.06 17:30-17:34 | Success | Path Building | Building WiFi-Hotspot, without DHCP, then mDNS and TCP again | Transfer is fast |
| 05.06 17:50-18:33 | Failure | Migration | Building WiFi-Hotspot, increase distance between devices, transfer stops, no cellular data used, failed after 20-30s | WiFi not enabled but also no probing on cellular performed |
| 05.06 18:22 | Failure | Migration | WiFi connectivity doesn't make a difference, no path being build, no migration | Both in WiFi, moving into different WiFi but no more connection |
| 05.06 19:32-19:49 | Success/Failure | Path Building | If moving the devices before the data transfer apart, using WiFi AP route, otherwise using WiFi-Hotspot | This is not always 100% reliable but my best explanation, sometimes still enabling the WiFi-Hotspot communication |
| 05.06 19:57 | Success | General Behavior of Everyone Mode | Can use mDNS and WiFi AP without WiFi-Hotspot, when closer? also WiFi-Hotspot |  |
| 06.06 10:47 | Success | Sharing between own devices | Using same AP path as before, same mechanisms as before | Small file, directly shared via AP, different section in UI to select own devices, doesn't show up in devices nearby section |
| 06.06 11:04 | Failure | Sharing between own devices | Using same AP path as before when moving apart fails and no path is found | No different behavior than sharing between contacts or other devices |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

### General Flow
The default flow of QuickShare transfers. Depends on the connection status

(If connected to WiFi)

1. Start Bluetooth exchange with infos like IP address and some google api service url
2. Switch to wifi interface and perform mdns discovery in local Network asking for \<unknown strings\>_tcp.local (IPv4 & IPv6); This is tried multiple times
3. Exchange with google api via TCP contains file infos, names, and other stuff?
4. Sender responds with only the second part of the string
5. Sender sends 2 ICMP ping to receiver (ttl=64) resulting in ARP
6. Receiver responds with 2 ICMP echo replies ttl=64
7. Sender builds TCP connection to receiver
8. Initial data like Phone Name, etc are exchanged **in plaintext**

*Start of transfer*

7. Then, the sender builds a WiFi-Direct network
8. Sender offers DHCP IPv4 to receiver and therefore knows the IP of the other end
9. Transfer is performed on this direct channel with new IPv4 (**not encrypted**, PDF can be restored with actual number of pages but currently blank due to some error I didn't look into)
10. TCP connection is gracefully closed with Fin/Fin Ack

Test notes:
- The local AP only supported IPv4, no IPv6 (DHCP Server)
- All tests muted (in video call and audio call)
- Moving hand in front of camera to induce data transfer
- Ring 3 times before accept

### General Flow
The default flow of WhatsApp Video Calls. For audio calls different!

Both in the same local WiFi AP

Caller:
1. TCP connection to WhatsApp (XMPP ports)
2. Probably SIP or other protocol to exchange call information via TCP
3. Reserve resources on Facebook TURN servers (always same port)
4. Success responses from the TURN servers
5. First data is transferred via TURN servers
6. Accept (or send) and return STUN Binding request (Binding Success, Binding request)
7. Exchange data via local WiFi AP
8. Sometimes exchange with Facebook TURN via TCP
9. Respond to local STUN binding refresh
10. Ending call
11. ICMP unreachable received
12. De-allocate STUN bindings on servers

Callee:
1. TCP Connection to WhatsApp (XMPP ports)
2. Receive call information via TCP
3. Reserve resources on Facebook TURN servers
4. Success responses from the TURN servers
5. First data is transferred via TURN servers
6. Send (or accept) Local STUN Binding request
7. Exchange data via local WiFi AP
8. Sometimes exchange with Facebook TURN via TCP
9. (Only in one tests) Make PATH MTU probe on cellular path towards Facebook TURN server, but don't use path
10. Send local STUN binding refresh
11. Ending call
12. ICMP unreachable received
13. De-allocate STUN bindings on servers


### Notes
During the analysis the following interesting information were found (for video calls):

- WhatsApp uses an unknown STUN attribute 0x4000. This attribute is in the range of non-optional attributes, but must not be registered by the IETF, rather by expert review (aka. should not be assigned by others). The purpose of this attribute is unclear
- 0x4000 is send at the beginning and end of the call, probably free the allocations, including a 150 byte identifier?
- Further attributes 0x4002, 0x4003, 0x4004, 0x4005, 0x4007, 0x4024 are observed but unclear what they mean
- 0x4002 is 8 bytes and corresponds with the TURN server address, for the same server it is the same in the response
- 0x4003 is observed on cellular link and WiFi at beginning of connection, probably telling that some mapping did not work? Length 9 byte on cellular later in connection, 1 byte on wifi with value 0xFF (-1 == error or not existent?) from server
- 0x4004 is padding of 452 bytes 0?
- 0x4007 is 2 bytes and in our case **always** 01f4 == 500
- Message Types 0x0801 and 0x0802, 0x0805 are observed
- 0x0801 has class request b00 and method 0x201, 0x0802 has class request b00 and method 0x202, 0x0805 has class b00 request and method 0x205
- All in value range where non-optional and assigned by IETF
- 0x801 is path MTU probe (Changed the delay between Probe indication and Report request to be RTO/2 or 50 milliseconds) confirmed above
- 0x802 is path MTU report
- Cellular one sided constantly switches between IPv4 and IPv6 (IPv4 mapped into IPv6), native IPv6 only for STUN
- Once STUN on loopback?
- Rapid and seamless switching between TURN endpoints in a **single** connection. Once Fra5, then the next chunk ams4, then back to fra, then muc...
